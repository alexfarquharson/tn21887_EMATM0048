    "## tron_classes.py\n",
    "* Creates player and board classes for game\n",
    "\n",
    "### Player class(es):\n",
    "* Holds attributes associated with players that do not effect board attributes.\n",
    "* Player class holds maximum methods/attributes that are common to both player and computer classes.\n",
    "* Human class requires additional method and function to create/show keys.\n",
    "* Computer class requires additional dofficulty input.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Board class:\n",
    "* Holds all atributes and methods to create game and run game.\n",
    "* Board setup depends on input variables: (table) dimension, game_type and player_type\n",
    "* In summary:\n",
    "    * Creates table, creates players\n",
    "    * Function to play game (depends on game_type)\n",
    "        * Gets, then checks human/computer move input\n",
    "        * Performs move (if legal)\n",
    "        * Repeat until a player makes an illegal move\n",
    "        * Outputs game conclusion, and resets table\n",
    "    * Computer input:\n",
    "        * Easy:\n",
    "            * Either random and non-suicidal\n",
    "        * Hard: **\n",
    "\n",
    "            * Assign a value to the resultant state of a possible move at that particular time point (value = 1 (if state exists +1 for each possible direction from that state)\n",
    "            * Create a hypothetical new board of that new state and then repeat previous step x times (max 9) (keeping the value of that previous state)\n",
    "            * At the max no. of iterations, sum the values of all states that lead to the final state, and assign the best paths value to the first move in a dictionary.\n",
    "            * Then return the move that has the highest path value (random choice if more than one)\n",
    "            * Assumptions: Other player does not move.\n",
    "            \n",
    "        * Both Computer functions then produce a check_move and direction_converted output that then is applied to the perform_xxxx functions to update the board and players positions.\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "## Discussion/thoughts as game was made\n",
    "\n",
    "* setup functions - lookup input into a dictionary as then only had to deal with keyerrors.\n",
    "\n",
    "* decided to have a player.position attribute that gets updated instead of calling a find_player method every time (this is more efficient, no need to iterate trhough table), and makes more sense that position is a player attribute not a board attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "* table design - went for this one as was the nicest and most consistent/simple (equal length of each row list) - easier for moveing players etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* play structure:\n",
    "    * tried to make functions as modular (so reusable) as possible, e.g.:\n",
    "    * all move related functions are irrelevant of game_type - (any dependence on this variable is restricted to differences in play_consecutive/play_simultaneous functions only)\n",
    "    * modified get_move to ensure all performing/checking move input is irrelevant of player type (and player_type dependence is restricted in the get_move function)\n",
    "    * originally had 4 up/left/down/right functions that checked if move was legal and performed move at once. changed to 8 check_up/perform_up functions - which checked and performed the move individually. This was because: Simultaneous game mode and computer move functions would benefit from a function that checks the move is legal without performing move. (Allowed me to remove complex head-on-crash draw logic, and use functions in get.check computer inputs).\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Easy computer discussion:\n",
    "    * Choose random direction results in very quick game (dies immediately).\n",
    "    * So improved to:\n",
    "        * Choose a random direction - check direction, remove from list if illegal, repeat until all directions tried.\n",
    "        * Use function recursively to repeat\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Smart computer discussion:\n",
    "    * Reading on dynamic programming/reinforcement learning, attempted to introduce a dynamic prgramming algorithm with the following parameters:\n",
    "        * Time: Finite. T = no. of free spaces/2\n",
    "        * States: No. of states is dependent on time - is number of free spaces\n",
    "        * Policy: Start with random policy (equal chance of up/down/left/right)\n",
    "        * Cost function: Use positive reinforcement: Assign positive value of +1 to each square (state) +1 for each possible direction from that state\n",
    "        * Unsuccessful in building this, as struggled trying to take into account the possible different states at the ultimate time T, T-1 etc.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    * Simpler method:\n",
    "        * Instead of working backward, work forwards, and only go a finite number of moves ahead (e.g. 9).\n",
    "        * Use same value calculation for each state - (only calculate value for the states in question instead of all states - quicker).\n",
    "        * Assume other player is stationary (this is inaccurate but too complex if try to model other player)\n",
    "        * This then resulted in the algorithm that I have - see earlier ** for description.\n",
    "        * Attempted to make function recursive and thus occur a maximum number of times (depending on no. of empty spaces left, but failed as needed to keep previous functions outputs, could have done but would have required a lot more time..)\n",
    "        * Structure considerations:\n",
    "            * Break up function into modular parts and then combine in the smart_move wrapper function.\n",
    "            * Get smart_move wrapper function to output the same as random_move and human_move - so compatible with rest of programme.\n",
